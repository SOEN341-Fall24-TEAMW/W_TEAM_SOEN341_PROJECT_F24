# W_TEAM_SOEN341_PROJECT_F24

## Project Description

A Peer Assessment System for university team projects is designed to allow students to evaluate the contributions and performance of their teammates based on four key dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. The system promotes accountability and provides valuable feedback to both students and instructors on team dynamics and individual efforts.

We identify two primary users: Students and Instructors.

## Team Member and Roles

- **Sara Razene Habte**: Software Engineer(mainly frontend)
- **Youssef Tassine**: Computer Engineer(data management and frontend)

## Peer Assessment Application

### Project Overview 
  The peer assessment application is mainly designed to let students evaluate the contribution of everyone in a certain team project. The application allows them to assess their teammates based on four different aspects: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution and work ethic. The whole system has for goal to contribute accountability and provides a valuable feedback to students and also to instructors enhancing the collaborative learning experience.

### Problem Statement
  In team-based projects, it is often difficultt to assess individual contributions fairly. Some team members may contribute more than others, while others may participate and work less without any visible repercussions. This lack of accountability can lead to people not being satisfated and some people working more than others in the team.

### Project Objective 
  This project is part of the SOEN 341 Software Process course for Fall 2024. The goal is to develop a functional model of the Peer Assessment System using the Agile development methodology, with sprints organized around essential features such as user authentication, team management, and peer evaluation. The Peer Assessment Application provides an anonymous platform for students to evaluate their peers, allowing instructors to get an idea of the team dynamics and making sure of a fair and balanced assessment process.

### Key Features

  1. Student Assessment
    - Anonymous Evaluations: Students can anonymously evaluate their teammates
    - Multi-Dimensional Rating: Peer evaluations are based on a 7-point scale across the four dimensions
    - Feedback: Optional comment sections allow for detailed feedback.
     
  2. Automated Score Sharing and Feedback
    - Score Aggregation: Individual scores are accumulated and combined to give instructors an overall assessment of each student's performance.
    - Anonymous Feedback: Students receive anonymous feedback to help improve future performance.

  3. Instructor Dashboard
    - Team Management: Instructors can create teams, assign students, and manage the evaluation process.
    - Detailed Reports: The dashboard provides detailed assessment results by team, by student, and a summary of results.


### Project Structure 
  The project is divided into multiple sprints, with the first sprint consists of the following:
  - Setting up the GitHub repository
  - Defining user stories and breaking down tasks
  - Implementing user authentication and team management features
