## Peer Assessment Application

### Project Overview
The peer assessment application enables students to evaluate each memberâ€™s contribution to team projects based on cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. It promotes accountability and provides valuable feedback, enhancing the collaborative learning experience for both students and instructors.

### Problem Statement
Accurately assessing individual contributions in team projects is challenging. A lack of transparency and accountability can result in an uneven distribution of responsibilities, leading to frustration and burnout.

### Project Objective
This project, part of the SOEN 341 Software Process course for Fall 2024, aims to develop a functional Peer Assessment System using Agile methodology. The application provides an anonymous platform for student evaluations, helping instructors better understand team dynamics and ensure fair assessments.

### Key Features

1. **Student Assessment**
   - **Anonymous Evaluations**: Students can evaluate teammates anonymously.
   - **Multi-Dimensional Rating**: Peer evaluations use a 7-point scale across four dimensions.
   - **Feedback**: Optional comment sections allow for detailed feedback.

2. **Automated Score Sharing and Feedback**
   - **Score Aggregation**: Scores are aggregated to provide an overall assessment for each student.
   - **Anonymous Feedback**: Students receive anonymous feedback for improvement.

3. **Instructor Dashboard**
   - **Team Management**: Instructors can create teams, assign students, and manage evaluations.
   - **Detailed Reports**: Provides comprehensive assessment results by team, student, and overall performance summary.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple sprints, with the first sprint covering:

- Setting up the GitHub repository
- Defining user stories and breaking down tasks
- Implementing user authentication and team management features
